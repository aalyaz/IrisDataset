# IrisDataset
Iris Dataset is a famous beginner's project; details of the project can be found in the README file.

🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
This project applies multiple supervised learning algorithms to classify iris flowers into one of three species, setosa, versicolor, and virginica, using the classic Iris dataset.

🚀 Features
🔍 Data exploration and preprocessing using pandas and seaborn
📊 Visualizations to understand feature distributions
🧠 Training and evaluation of 5 machine learning models:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
*Gaussian Naive Bayes

✅ Accuracy and classification reports for each model
🧪 Results
All models achieved 100% accuracy on the test set due to the simplicity and well-separated nature of the dataset.
